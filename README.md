# Achievement-6



Data Source

The data originates from the UK government data website.

The dataset explores the number of arrests for ‘notifiable offences’ - which are offences where the police in England and Wales, must complete a Crime report. 

Data Collection

The dataset explores ethnicity, sex and police force region or area. 

Data has been collected by the UK Home Office and is published on ‘Ethnicity facts and figures’. In the dataset these figures are primarily concerned with Arrests data March 2013 to March 2019.

Data consistency

I link that this dataset comes from England, where I currently reside. I can relate to variables concerned with Geographical location and have a basic understanding of police laws here.

I’m also keen to explore arrests by ethnicity to determine whether there are any disparities, if any, or similarities within the socioeconomic groups and the impact(s) this may have on the Police. 

Data limitations and ethical considerations

The dataset has not included data from Lancashire police force who were unable to provide arrests data.

The city of London police force has also not been included to ensure best sampling methods.

The dataset provides ethical considerations by not disclosing ‘reason for arrest’. I think this could have had fostered or created new social biases.

Some questions to explore.

-	How do arrests compare between different ethnic backgrounds in the regions of England and Wales?

-	Have their been any trends based on previous data?

-	How do arrests compare between male/female from different regions?
